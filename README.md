Automating D&amp;D functions and mechanics

Script 1: Combat manager<br /> 
Takes in player and enemy names, their initiative rolls, and (if necessary) their dexterity modifiers. Uses this info to generate a combat turn order and keep track of who goes when. Takes into account deaths, revivals, and new combatants on a turn by turn basis, adding them/removing them from the initiative order as necessary.
